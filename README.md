# gitops-tenant-template

A template for **GitOps tenants** on the
[devantler-tech platform](https://github.com/devantler-tech/platform) — an
application that runs on the platform from its own repository. The template ships
the shared, **framework-agnostic** CI/CD plumbing (build → signed publish →
release) and keeps it current in every tenant via
[template-sync](https://github.com/AndreasAugustin/actions-template-sync).

It is intentionally **stack-neutral**: it carries no application code or
language-specific tooling. Bring your own stack (any language, any framework) and
fill in the scaffolding.

## Use this template

1. Click **"Use this template" → Create a new repository** (or
   `gh repo create devantler-tech/<tenant> --template devantler-tech/gitops-tenant-template --private`).
2. **Rename the placeholders** in `deploy/` to your tenant name — run
   [`scripts/rename-placeholders.sh`](scripts/rename-placeholders.sh) (defaults to
   the repo directory name, or pass one: `scripts/rename-placeholders.sh my-tenant`).
   It rewrites the `app`, `REPLACE_ME`, and `replace-me` placeholders
   consistently, including the container name, Vault role, and ServiceAccount.
   Those values **must** equal the repo name (see the convention below). The
   helper preserves the `app.kubernetes.io/name` label *keys*, CloudNativePG's
   literal `-app` secret suffix, and the `openbao` SecretStore name. (Doing this
   by hand is easy to get half-wrong.) It's a one-shot helper — delete it once
   adopted.
3. Replace the rest of the scaffolding with your app: application code,
   `Dockerfile`, the `ci.yaml` jobs, and fill in `AGENTS.md`.
4. Create `.templatesyncignore` (see below).
5. Register the tenant on the platform — follow
   [`platform/docs/TENANTS.md`](https://github.com/devantler-tech/platform/blob/main/docs/TENANTS.md).

## What the template owns vs. what you own

template-sync overwrites the files the template **owns** and never touches the
files **you own**. Declare the files you own in **`.templatesyncignore`** (same
syntax as `.gitignore`). template-sync only ever brings over files that exist in
this template, so you only need to ignore the scaffolding files below — not your
app code.

**Owned by the template (kept in sync — do not edit in your tenant):**

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/cd.yaml` | On a `v*` tag, calls `publish-app.yaml` to build, digest-pin, push, and **cosign-sign** the image + manifests OCI artifact |
| `.github/workflows/release.yaml` | semantic-release on `main` (cuts the `v*` tags that drive `cd.yaml`) |
| `.github/workflows/template-sync.yaml` | Opens the weekly template-sync PR |
| `.github/workflows/sync-labels.yaml` | Syncs the repo's issue/PR labels from the canonical label set |
| `CLAUDE.md` | `@AGENTS.md` shim |
| `zizmor.yml` | GitHub Actions pinning policy enforced by the security scan |

**Scaffold-time only (arrives when the repo is created — never re-synced, so a
tenant still carrying these from an older sync can delete them for good):**

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/validate-scaffold.yaml` | Renders `deploy/`, schema-validates every resource, applies the live Platform/shared Kyverno policies, and submits the Pod produced by the Deployment to a pinned Kubernetes API that enforces the platform's Pod Security `restricted` level. Its positive path plus privilege, capability, and non-root negative controls catch day-one admission failures before a tenant is created. It gates template PRs and rechecks upstream admission drift every Monday at 06:17 UTC (or on manual dispatch); structural mutation tests keep every layer fail-closed. The workflow no-ops in tenants and is scaffold-time only |
| `scripts/rename-placeholders.sh` (+ its test) | One-shot rename of the placeholder app to your tenant name |
| `scripts/agent-instructions.test.sh` | Fails closed if the one-time agent scaffold loses its ownership, bot, external-code, exact-head review, or user-path evaluation boundaries |
| `scripts/pod-security-admission*.test.sh` | Proves the rendered Deployment is accepted at Pod Security `restricted` while unsafe mutations are denied, and pins that live gate against structural bypasses |

**Yours (list these in `.templatesyncignore`):**

```

`AGENTS.md` and the `maintain` skill ship as scaffolding (a starting point for new
tenants) but are **yours** — they carry your project-specific overview, so they are
ignored from sync. `.github/CODEOWNERS` is likewise yours: it names *your* tenant's
code owners, so template-sync never overwrites it.

## How publishing works

`release.yaml` turns Conventional-Commit merges to `main` into `vX.Y.Z` tags.
Each tag triggers `cd.yaml`, which calls the platform's
[`publish-app.yaml`](https://github.com/devantler-tech/actions/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish-app.yaml)
reusable workflow to build the image, **pin its digest into
`deploy/deployment.yaml`**, push the manifests as an OCI artifact, and
**cosign-sign** both. The platform's `OCIRepository` verifies that signature, so
only artifacts from this trusted workflow are reconciled.

> **Convention:** the Deployment's container `name` MUST equal the repository
> name — `publish-app` pins the built image digest into the container with that
> name (`app-name: ${{ github.event.repository.name }}` in `cd.yaml`).

## Validate locally

```sh
kubectl kustomize deploy/                              # manifests build
sh scripts/rename-placeholders.test.sh                # onboarding contract
sh scripts/agent-instructions.test.sh                 # agent safety contract
actionlint .github/workflows/*                         # workflows parse
```
